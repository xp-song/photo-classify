The HTML document `Photo_classification.html` demonstrates how to generate photograph keywords using the [Google Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/), and classify photographs based on similarities between their keywords. The file is viewable at [this link](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/xp-song/photo-classify/blob/master/Photo-classification.html). 

The same file is viewable partially-rendered in intermediate markdown (`Photo_classification.md`), or in [this blog post](https://xp-song.github.io/posts/photo-classify/2019-06-17-photo-classify/).


Photograph metadata in the 'data' folder is used as an example.
