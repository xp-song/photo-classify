# Photograph classification using generated keywords

This repository documents the workflow and R code that can be used to classify a large number of photographs based on their image content. Contents are downloadable on [Figshare](https://figshare.com/s/36f9490f3cf8f63885c4).


The script demonstrates how to generate photograph keywords using the [Google Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/), and classify photographs based on similarities between their keywords. It is written in [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). View the HTML file `Photo_classification.html` at [this link](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/xp-song/photo-classify/Photo_classification.html). See `Photo_classification.md` for a partially-rendered version of the HTML document (intermediate markdown).




Photograph metadata in the 'data' folder is used as an example.
