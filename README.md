# Automated image classification into content-type categories

This repository documents the workflow and R code that can be used to classify a large number of images into discrete categories, based on their content. It provides supplementary information to the following paper:  

Song, X.P., Richards, D.R., Tan, P.Y. (2019). Using social media user attributes to understand humanâ€“environment interactions at urban parks (in review).

The HTML document `Photo_classification.html` demonstrates how to generate photograph keywords using the [Google Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/), and classify photographs based on similarities between their keywords. The file is viewable at [this link](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/xp-song/photo-classify/Photo_classification.html). See `Photo_classification.md` for a partially-rendered version of the HTML document (intermediate markdown). 



Photograph metadata in the 'data' folder is used as an example.
